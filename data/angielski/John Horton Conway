John Horton Conway FRS (26 December 1937 â€“ 11 April 2020) was an English mathematician. He was active in the theory of f
inite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He also made contributions to man
y branches of recreational mathematics, most notably the invention of the cellular automaton called the Game of Life.

Born and raised in Liverpool, Conway spent the first half of his career at the University of Cambridge before moving to
the United States, where he held the John von Neumann Professorship at Princeton University for the rest of his career.[

Early life and education

Conway was born on 26 December 1937 in Liverpool, the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce.[2][4] He became intere
sted in mathematics at a very early age. By the time he was 11, his ambition was to become a mathematician.[5][6] After
leaving sixth form, he studied mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.[4] A "terribly introverted adolesce
nt" in school, he took his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into an extrovert, a change whi
ch would later earn him the nickname of "the world's most charismatic mathematician".[7][8]

Conway was awarded a BA in 1959 and, supervised by Harold Davenport, began to undertake research in number theory. Havin
g solved the open problem posed by Davenport on writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers, Conway became interested in
 infinite ordinals.[6] It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the Cambridge Mathematical
 Tripos, where he became an avid backgammon player, spending hours playing the game in the common room.[2]

In 1964, Conway was awarded his doctorate and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at Sidney Suss
ex College, Cambridge.[9]

After leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at Princeton Un
iversity.[9] There, he won the Princeton University Pi Day pie-eating contest.[10]
Conway and Martin Gardner

Conway's career was intertwined with that of Martin Gardner. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his Mathemat
ical Games column in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrit
y.[11][12] Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently writte
n about recreational aspects of Conway's work.[13] For instance, he discussed Conway's game of Sprouts (July 1967), Hack
enbush (January 1972), and his angel and devil problem (February 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway
's book On Numbers and Games and even managed to explain Conway's surreal numbers.[14]

Conway was a prominent member of Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote h
im long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for inf
ormation on the Penrose tilings which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major pro
perties of the tilings.[15] Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977
 column.[16] The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conwa
 y.[12]
